# Changelog

## 4.0.0

This is the release of our new SDKs, `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`. While there are too many changes to list for
this release, we will keep a consistent changelog for upcoming new releases. `raven-js` (our legacy JavaScript/Browser
SDK) and `raven` (our legacy Node.js SDK) will still reside in this repo, but they will receive their own changelog. We
generally guide people to use our new SDKs from this point onward. The migration should be straight forward if you were
only using basic features of our previous SDKs. `raven-js` and `raven` will both still receive bugfixes but all new
features implemented will only work in the new SDKs.

In general a good starting point are [`our docs`](https://docs.sentry.io).
