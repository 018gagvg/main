# Sentry Integration for Feedback

This integration supports our browser feedback SDK allowing us to code-split heavy UI components as needed.

For the primary Feedback Integration see
[Sentry Feedback SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/develop/packages/feedback)

Note: This package is only meant to be used internally.
