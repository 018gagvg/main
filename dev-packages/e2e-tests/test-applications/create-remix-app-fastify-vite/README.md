# Welcome to Remix + Vite + Fastify + Sentry!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite)
for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Express server with Vite dev middleware:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

## Sentry Events Inspection

After you have launched the app with `pnpm dev:events`, visit the index page and open your browser's network tab. You
will find there an event sent to `Sentry` and correlated server event will be written to `tests/events` directory.
